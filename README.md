# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
Hi I am Pushkar!  I really like data.  And I like visualizations.  So I guess you can say that I like data visualizations!

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. I look back at my ghosts of presentations past, and I cringe because they were ugly and they were ineffective. In the future I want to convey my ideas effectively
2. I want to learn how to tell stories with data.
3. How to make sense of data and what chart to use for what data.
